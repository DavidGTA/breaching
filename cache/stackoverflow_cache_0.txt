i think that the usefulness of with can be dependent on how well your code is written .then you could argue that with will improve the readability of the code by doing this :conversely , it could be argued that you're violating the law of demeter , but , then again , maybe not .assuming you'd like to set this up whenever the page loads , you could do something like this :secondly , i always recommend keeping the javascript in an external file and then managing the event handler there .first , there are two ways to setup the href - you can either do as you have stated above with the href referencing a ' # ' , or you may set the href to reference " javascript : ; "lastly , the java api is a great resource , in my opinion .i can't think of a time when i didn't find what i was looking for on that site .the books presentation is okay - some of the code is crunched on some pages , but the material is solid .for information on building data structures or implementing algorithms using the java language , i recommend data structures & algorithms in java .personally , i think that if you read through head first and then work on some personal projects and keep the java api by your side you'll be good to go .i don't know how much experience you have in c + + , but assuming you've got a pretty good grasp of that language as well as object-oriented concepts , i recommend reading head first java - it's a really easy read and will catch you up with an overview of the language ( including basic threading and sockets ) .that's a lot of work .remember that a character has-a set of weapons .to me , it seems like composition may be the way to go .with that said , i'd imagine that you're going to want to unequip a weapon via some unique id , say :patterns occur naturally - the behavior you're describing isn't really part of the decorator pattern .instead , perhaps it's worth considering @ mitch's idea and let the character's weapons be help in a property bag .if you'd try to fit this into the decorator pattern , you'd have to keep track of the currently equipped items and then , after removing a weapon , you'd have to update the reference of the object decorating the lightsaber to the one lightsaber is decorating .i see what you're trying to do , but one of the things to remember about patterns is that you shouldn't try to shoe-horn your design to fit a pattern .i'd be embarrassed to let anyone see the source .i've got other odds and end utilities , as well , but they are kind of hacked together for personal use .it's more or less based on the way that i structure my xhtml and format my css , but hopefully you'll find it useful .several people have asked for my stylesheet skeleton generator in the comments so i'm providing a link to the project here .because i primarily do web development , i've abstracted out some common features that i end up doing frequently on sites for clients .there are a number of javascript obfuscation tools that are freely available ;to that end , there are several options that i've used to some degree overtime :however , i think it's important to note that it is difficult to obfuscate javascript to the point where it cannot be reverse-engineered .the majority of the posts are related to ubuntu ;it's essentially an aggregation of a number of blogs .an additional resource is also the ubuntu channel on irc .planet ubuntu is a pretty good feed to keep in your reader .however , there are occasional posts that are just about the developer's thoughts and opinions .these two sites demonstrate just how helpful , organized , and motivated the ubuntu community is .lastly , i tend to learn a lot from reading blogs from people that are heavily involved in ubuntu's development .in my personal experience with ubuntu , the two places that i consistently found help were ubuntu forums and ubuntu wiki .whenever i was stuck with an issue that i felt warranted a discussion with someone ( or a handful of people ) , irc was always a good place to go .ruby on rails has the prototype framework available .this framework is used by script . aculo . us and it provides an autocompleter control that may provide the functionality that you're seeking .even so , i'm always hesitant to use multiple frameworks on my web projects ;admittedly , this was a small tool that didn't use a wide array of the controls .plus , with jquery's noconflict ( ) mode and yui's namespacing , the two frameworks really shouldn't trump one another .however , if you're only using jquery's dom functionality and yui's control functionality , then i think you're fine - there's not really a conflict of interest there .speaking from some experience in developing a small tool myself , i've used yui's rich control set with prototype for dom manipulation in the past and experienced no issues .this code assumes that you have an anchor or that will trigger to movement when it is clicked :from a purely accessible standpoint , they aren't so great .finally , as far as my personal opinions are concerned , i don't mind modal windows .they usually have a more cohesive feel to the site than either of the two aforementioned method .i guess , to sum it up , if i had to choose how i'd like to be interrupted , then i'd choose a modal dialog .to combat this , it's always a good idea to degrade gracefully - one suggestion is to take the content of the modal dialog and place it on a page .whenever the modal dialog should appear , have the current page redirect to the ' modal page ' , get the user's input , and return to the page it was on .they typically require javascript , and , because of the way that modals are managed with respect to the dom , screen readers will not interpret them well .i think that , when used correctly , they provide a decent experience - if something has to get my attention , then i'd rather it do so without redirecting me from the page , showing an ugly operating system themed dialog , or a pop-up ( which my browser will likely block , anyway ) .from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as , say , dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows .aside from pictures or media , i've used modal dialogs to serve the same purpose as dialog boxes - to get the user to give some form of required input , or to acknowledge something before letting them interact with the site again .inclusioncompressionorganizationthis doesn't happen terribly often , though .the directory structure normally goes something like this :if a page doesn't require any script , there will be no script inclusions on that page .all of my scripts are maintained in a directory structure that i follow whenever i work on a site .though there are a lot of different compressors and obfuscators out there , i always come back to yui compressor .if , on the off chance , that i'm working on a team uses an inordinate amount of scripts , then i'll normally create a custom directory in which we'll organize scripts by relationship .unless a site is using some form of a master page , cms , or something that dictates what can be included on a page beyond my control , i only included the scripts necessarily for the given page just for the small performance sake .is there a more efficient way to convert an htmlcollection to an array , other than iterating through the contents of said collection and manually pushing each item into an array ?similar to what @ roburg has mentioned , i normally do something like :for a true button effect , i also like to introduce a hover or a focus style .this will give the illusion that the button has been pressed even though it isn't a true button , per se .it continues on for a while .the code is obviously verbose and it feels like it could be improved .i'm currently working on a project where a section of the code looks like this :is there any way to dynamically invoke a property in vb . net such that something like this can be done :this can be done by :in order to combat that , append a unique token to the end of the url you're going to be hitting .this will append a unique timestamp to the end of the url and will prevent any caching from happening .regardless of how you end up doing your get request - vanilla javascript , prototype , jquery , etc - make sure that you put a mechanism in place to combat caching .ie will cache urls in order to make loading faster , but if you're , say , polling a server at intervals trying to get new information , ie will cache that url and will likely return the same data set you've always had .i find thatlooks much better thanfor very long statements that simply set properties .i've noticed that there are some issues with using with while debugging ;however , i was wondering if there were any compelling reasons to avoid using with in practice ?for the sake of convenience and readability , i often use the with statement to set these properties .at work , i'm frequently working on projects where numerous properties of certain objects have to be set during their construction or early during their lifetime .i've always assumed the code generated via the compiler for the above two cases is basically the same which is why i've always chosen to write what i feel to be more readable .for the look and feel i . . .before installing any software i . . .using the add\remove windows components in control panel , i always remove . . .for tools ( outside of my ides and other necessary development tools ) , i install . .short answer :jquery makes this really easy .no , you don't need to have the select box within a form .where is your javascript currently included with respect to the body tag in your html ?rather than keeping code at the bottom of the markup , you can include this in your head node :i'm no fan of mixing javascript and markup together , but this demo should work for all intents and purposes .at this point , the select box will not have been parsed and , thus , your code cannot access it in order to disable it .remember that if you have inline javascript included in the head if your page , then it will fire as the page is loaded .lastly , rather than incorporate an onchange handler in the attributes of your markup , you could alternatively setup an event handler in your javascript to perform the same behavior .if , for whatever reason , you have to keep the script located in the page rather than an external file , you could setup an event handler to perform the same functionality after the page has loaded .the way that i would go about doing it is this :i could be misinterpreting your question , but , yes , this is possible .now , whenever this element is clicked , the code in clickhandler will execute .similarly , you can execute the same code by calling the function from within the context of other functions ( or even assign clickhandler to handle events triggered by other elements ) >otherwise , it will remain null .create a node class and give it an instance variable of type node .initialize it to null - if said node is connected to another node , then this instance variable will refer to it ;if the node may be connected to numerous nodes ( which is quite common for graphs ) , then use an arraylist to store all of the nodes to which said node is connected .however , it's possible albeit a little tedious .i'm unclear on the implementation details you are seeking ( such as background , or just a border along the side of the window , etc ) ;one example that comes to mind would be to have n-block level elements , such as divs , and then give them each a small height ( a couple of pixels , for example ) and then gradually change the background color of each subsequent element .the good parts by douglas crockford .once you get a good grasp on the language , i highly recommend javascript :others have made some great suggestions ( the rhino books , mozilla developer center , and references such as w3 schools ) .otherwise , it could it overwritten .have you tried rake db : schema : dump ?note that you should rename schema . rb once it contains the dump ;it'll take all of the tables and indexes in said database and then write it out to schema . rb .essentially , make sure that your database . yml file is referencing the database you wish to dump , and then run the command .here's an update of the ticket i submitted .it seems as if @ webdawson has attached a sample page to the ticket .this has worked well enough for sometime ;i've been keeping a tally of downloads by doing this :i have a personal project that's been online for sometime now .thus , the only way to download the project is to left-click on the link .however , it prevents users from being able to right-click > save target as . . .for what it's worth , the machine is a standard lamp stack , so no . net options here .because they'll actually just see download . php appear in the " file save . . " dialog .so , what are some better ways to transparently log downloads without getting in the user's way ?i'd like to improve the process so that a user can download the project using whatever method with which s / he is most comfortable .it all depends on your audience .also , i noticed in your question that you are using innerhtml .if no one in your audience is using chrome , then don't sweat it ;this is actually a non-standard way of inserting data into a page .the best practice is to create a text node and append it to another element node .however , if you're looking to reach the biggest audience possible , then it's best to support all major a-grade browserswith respect to your final question , you're going to hear some people say that your work should work across all of the browsers .i'm assuming that you're wanting to insert a style tag versus a link tag ( referencing an external css ) , so that's what the following example does :go figure .here's the relevant code :the code works fine in firefox , opera , chrome , and safari , but not ie7 .thanks in advance for any ideas and / or suggestions on how to address this .the parsenodes function is never actually being hit because ie cannot access firstchild and , consequently , nodevalue .i'm attempting to load up an xml document ( specifically an rss feed ) via an ajax request , parse it , and insert some information based on said feed into my page .after doing some initial debugging , i've found that the xml string is being retrieved via the request , and the specific node type i'm getting when trying to parse nodes out of the document is htmlunknownelement .and then from there , you can call this function with the set label content and offset coordinates :then just add the element to the graph's container ( assuming that is has an id of , say , graph ) :of course , i'm not really familiar with birt and i'm making the assumption that the graph's red markers will vary .in order to dynamically center some type of label in each quadrant of the graph , you'll have to have some way of calculating the coordinates .anyway , assuming that you can get the coordinates , you could write a function that would dynamically generate the label based on a couple of parameters :it's performance is going to be based on how complex your pages are ;however , for relatively lightweight pages , it should provide some insight .there is a version of firebug called firebug lite that will work with internet explorer .i recommend this tool rather than simply using firebug and firefox because not all errors that occur in internet explorer will occur in firefox , and so performing any debugging in that browser may not yield any results .behavior like this is accomplished using javascript .i wouldn't be surprised if hidden fields are also being manipulated .this includes adding fields , removing fields , toggling class names , etc .paolo's answer gives a really good , straight-forward example of how that behavior can be emulated .. net really wouldn't come into play until you're ready to take the specified query and begin running it against your data store .it can definitely be implemented using visual studio 2008 as it's really ( and likely ) nothing more than css , javascript , and html .specifically ( and at a very high-level ) , there are event handlers attached to the links each of which modify the dom in their own way .after doing a quick inspection of the search field using firebug , it appears that clicking on each of search type links ( web , images , etc ) simply modifies the dom .there's not really a standard way to do this - it's just the nature of the beast ;however , adobe is currently working on browserlabs which should help to solve this exact issue .here's one way you can do it :as marr75 mentioned , get ' s are cached .there are a couple of ways to combat this .this way , ie will think it is a different url each time it is requested .there are multiple ways to do this ( such as using math . random ( ) , a variation on the date , etc ) .aside from modifying the response header , you can also append a randomly generated query string variable to the end of the targeted url .that separator is actually a table cell contained within a table row .there are variations on how to do this , but here's a very , very rough example :it maintains a background-color and background-image to give it the effect similar to what you'd see in a desktop application .i'm not sure to what extend you'd want to do this , but assuming that the table cell is already specified in the markup and it has the appropriate styles , you'd need to setup several things :cssjavascriptgreg's approach is also good especially if you have to do everything in the javascript source .i would specify a classname in the javascript source and let an external css file take care of actually applying the formatting to it .client-sideserver-sideit's possible but only to a degree .you're going to need some server-side code to help you out .without seeing your predefined format , it's tough to make any suggestions .from here , it would seem as if you'd need to break down the process into the following :at an abstract level , i'm assuming that an event will be composed of a time , a date , and a location .it's a big security risk .php's curl library is good for this .it passes any required parameters to this page .javascript isn't allowed to make cross-domain requests .note the success function in the first block of javascript code above .a javascript response handler function can then parse the incoming response data .javascript initiates an ajax request to a page ( or script ) located on your server .this should probably be validated before responding back , but it's just an example .for example , assuming that you're using javascript and php you could setup the application to work like this :when the cross-domain website responds , your server-side code can echo the response back to the initial request .instead , you'll have to execute a script on the server and have it return the results to your javascript function .the server-side code will respond to the request and pass along the necessary parameters to the cross-domain website .the following code is based on jquery ( for the sake of being concise ) , but the principles are the same regardless of your framework .json would be perfect for this .once it's available on the server , you can process it however you like .basically , you'll want to convert your object to it's json representation and then send that across the wire .crockford has a great article on what json is , how to understand the notation , and he provides a tool to convert your objects to json notation .either way , maybe this will help :your question is confusing because you're using the same variable name , data , outside of your request as well as in the request callback .based on the code you provided , it would appear that data is considered to be duplicated if the server returns yes once the post completes .i'm not sure if you're asking to check for duplication based on data that has already been submitted and is back on the page , data that exists on the server , or if the data's simply " yes " .you could also just update the existing reference to a new instance of an object :i'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do , but there are a couple of ways to go about resetting an array .you could just iterate through the existing array and set each index equal to null ( or an empty string or 0 or whatever value you consider to be a reset ) :nonetheless , here's an example that should achieve the result you're aiming for :just as others have noticed , i think that there is something wrong with the code that you're using to dynamically generate the anchors .you would could then utilize it by doing something like this :note that you would have to make the boolean value publicly accessible in the context of the autocomplete object .again , without knowing the specifics if your implementation it's difficult to say how best to change it but it could work something like this :i don't know if you're using a specific plug-in or if you have the ability to easily modify the autocomplete source code , but i would attempt to do something like this :600 , 000 characters is larger than that .the maximum size for a textarea in firefox is 64k ( it could be just 32k , i can't recall ) .if the size of the text that you're pasting into the textarea does in fact exceed that size , then there's nothing you can do about it .of course , one alternative would be to put some type of restriction on the data going into the field and then give the user some feedback as to why their data won't fit .the general steps are to :you can check out the full resolution here .i had a similar issue like this sometime ago using jquery .the problem was that , in ie , the incoming response data needed to be handled by the microsoft . xmldom activex object .because cross-site requests can't be done from the client , they need to be initiated from the server .i'm personally not familiar with hiveminder , but the way in which you achieve requests from one domain to another is generally :i don't know what language your using , but since you mentioned curl you may be interested in checking out what php offers in its curl manual .edit . . .i'm working on a jquery plugin that can be applied to multiple elements .is there are a way to detect multiple instances when the plugin is used as in the second example /what's the best way to detect if the plugin has been applied to a single element or to multiple elements ?the plugin includes some animation effects and i need to manage the event queue based on if the plugin is used on multiple elements ( instead of one ) .the length property works correctly if the plugin is passed multiple elements ( such as $ ( ' . myclass ' ) . plugin ( ) ) but if the plugin is called on multiple , single elements ( such as $ ( ' # myelem1 ' ) . plugin ( ) and $ ( ' # myelem2 ' ) . plugin ( ) ) then the length returns one for each call .i have a user model :and a relationship model :in my project , i have a self-referential association .when two users are peers with one another , there are obviously two records in the database .when one user opts to end a relationship , i'd like this to destroy both records - not just one side of the relationship .is there a better way to go about doing this rather than loading the relationship twice in the controller ( once for each side of the relationship ) ?why not grab it from the image itself ?you may also be able to refactor that final block of code operating on the photowindow like this :from your code , it looks as if you're attempting to pull the ewidth from the width of the photowindow element .i may also be missing something , but i'm unclear as to why you're performing a fadein ( ) and a show ( ) on the photowindow - fadein ( ) will display the element once it's completed firing .simple example , but that should do it .you can see more in-depth examples of jquery's $ . get ( ) on the api page .you could do something like this ( assuming that mymodel has a display of none ) :although you don't need to use jquery ( or any other library , for that matter ) to handle the ajax request and response , it makes it much easier especially when dealing with cross-browser nuances .assuming that the html file is on the same domain as the site ( because cross-domain requests won't work ) , you can initiate an ajax request to retrieve the data and insert it into the containing element .to apply a stylesheet with jquery , you can do this :i'm a fan of keeping css in a separate file and then importing it using the plugin .if you want to make sure that you're not loading the stylesheet multiple times , you can do something like this :obviously , you'll need to know the path to the css file but if you ship a css directory with your plugin , this shouldn't be problem .overtime , this makes it easier to maintain and it makes it easier for users or future developers to work with your plugin rather than digging through javascript source ( which will likely grow overtime ) .as far as " ensuring [ your ] component gets the css it needs , " the first option will work file as long as you make sure your elements have a unique identifier ( classname or id ) that the javascript source can access .you can refactor your code a little bit and do something like this :if that's what you're experiencing , then reading the quirks mode article on events may help you pinpoint what's up .one option would to be to store the cell's current border color in a variable and then reset it once the mouse leaves the cell .from your code above , it appears as if the color to which you want to return it is consistent so you can probably just store it in its own variable .admittedly , i ran your code but i'm not completely sure that the solution i've provided is what you're looking for because there is some behavior happening related to event bubbling .all of that information is covered in-depth at the mozilla developer center .if you need to do this in a post , then check out jquery's $ . post or even the $ . ajax documentation .assuming that you're using jquery ( which i can't tell from your question if you are or aren't ) , then you'd do this :if you're not using jquery , then you can still achieve this using vanilla javascript , but you'll need to look at the xhr object order to determine if you're ready to fire the callback .as others have noted in the comments , your question really doesn't make sense but if you're looking to fire something off when an ajax request has completed then you need to setup a callback function .one option would be to write a greasemonkey script that attaches an event handler to each link on the page .once the link is clicked , you intercept it's it's href attribute and then it let it continue processing it's standard behavior .in your controller :and then in your associated view :however , you can try something like this . . .based on what you've specified , i can't tell if your controller is properly pulling back users or not ;from what i can tell , your user model has a a status property that denotes whether or not the user is online .finally , you're probably going to want to move the above code into a partial and then setup an ajax polling mechanism that will check the server at a certain interval to make sure that your list is up to date .and a validator :something such as :my controller's create method looks like this :specifically , my employee model has a hash of roles :instead , i receive the validation message that the " role can't be blank . "ideally , i'd like to populate a select box in a form using this information .although i can display the values in the select box , the data isn't serialized .i'm attempting to setup a form for a model that contains a select box populated from a collection in the hash .ultimately , my question is how do i populate the select box using the hash in the model and properly save the value of the select box to the column on the employee model in the database ?i think you may be making it more complicated than it needs to be : ) .if you take a look at the sample code , you can also easily apply effects .rather than using toggle ( ) , you could use something like fadetoggle ( ) .i wrote up a quick jsfiddle for reference , but i'd say that you could make a couple of changes to the way you've got your markup structured that would make the transitions much cleaner :for example :for the second option , you could then split ( ) on the classnames to examine what other values are available .without seeing any code , it's difficult to know the context of the question , but the key is to look for a defining attribute of the element in question ./ % postname % / and that would take care of it .if that's the case , then you can use a custom permalink setting set to :without any more context to the question , it's a little difficult to say ;however , based on the url scheme that you've provided , ' special ' appears to be a category , custom post type , or some other taxonomy .currently , my script is doing the following :once the gem has been installed , the script continues execution ;however , the gem hasn't been loaded so all code requiring rubyzip2 halts the execution .how do i load the gem into memory so that the script can continue running after installation ?i have a small ruby script that i'm writing to automate the preparation of a development environment on local machines .because i can't be certain that the rubyzip2 library is present on all of the machines , i'm having the script install it when needed .this is the correct way to do it , though .when using either of those api functions , you're relinquishing control to wordpress for writing them out to the browser .additionally , if you look at the source code for the function , you'll notice that there are no calls to apply_filters so you're unable to provide any kind of customization to what wordpress does when writing these out .do the controls have a unique id or class name ?are you using a specific framework ( jquery , prototype , etc ) ?this may sound like a very general solution , but it's hard to give any concrete code without knowing more about your setup .you say that you need to validate that at least three of the options should be selected , but is there a chance that you'd need to validate more than those three ?without knowing more about your project , it's hard to make any solid suggestions , but using pure javascript ( without a framework ) , and assuming that you have , say , unique class names i'd say . . .@ gumbo's answer provides the best way to check for null ;there's a really good article about the difference in two terms here .after reading your clarification , @ ates goral's answer provides how to perform the same operation you're doing in c # in javascript .however , it's important to note the difference in = = versus = = = in javascript especially when it comes to issues of checking for undefined and / or null .basically , understand that if you use = = instead of = = = , javascript will try to coalesce the values you're comparing and return what the result of the comparison after this coalescence .i'm currently working on a small application that works like this :i'm not really a php developer , so i am looking for some best practices with respect to cross-domain requests .i'm currently using file _ get _ contents ( ) to retrieve the json feed and , although it's functional , it seems like a weak solution .scriptaculous has a decent drag and drop implementation .it's based on prototype which has a pretty good community .jquery's does seem to be a bit larger and a more active as of late so you may want to stick with its draggable library .a copy of my . htaccess file is below :the problem is that there's a second domain :how can i construct my rules in the following way :i currently have a website setup in the following way :product . com that is pointing to example . com / product .as the . htaccess file is configured , all incoming requests are mapped to blog . example . com .this is because the blog subdomain is a mirror of the main domain and is what will be used moving forward .this means that going to product . com will result in blog . example . com / product in which the ideal scenario is to have example . com / product and all other incoming requests be redirected to blog . example . com .i've used this library for a couple of personal projects .client-side-only validation is rarely , if ever , a good idea .i'm sure you already do this , but also validate all of your information on the server-side , as well .it's pretty good , though i have had to make my own modifications to it a couple of times - nothing major , though , and it's easy enough to do so .idesbooksvideoswebsitesframeworksyou're automatically creating a level of abstraction for yourself .knowing the language prior to learning jquery or any other framework will help enhance your ability to understand what the framework is doing , how to write better code , and how to implement a feature into the framework that you wish was there but isn't .with that said , here's a set of resources that i have found to be extremely helpful in learning javascript ( some of them have already been mentioned ) :additionally , there are other frameworks available , but jquery and prototype are the ones with which i'm most familiar and have found them to be really useful .i think that there are a lot of good answers here with a lot of good suggestions , however , i also disagree with most of the answers that say " start learning with jquery . " i'm passionately against learning a framework for a language before learning the language in which the framework is implemented .yes , there are more websites , books , and videos that can help you get started , but for someone that has a programming background , i can't imagine that picking up javascript would be utterly difficult .first , i recommend reading a book such as jquery in action .it's a well-written , informative , easy-to-follow book all about the framework .with that said , i don't know of any " open source software projects " per se , but check out any major site that uses the framework .the jquery website mentions various sites that utilize the framework , and i'm sure a quick google search would return more than enough results to keep you busy .i always find that reading a book about a framework helps to expose a lot of the things available in the api that simply aren't likely to be revealed in just hacking together projects .case in point , i've seen numerous answers about jquery on stack overflow that talk about how to accomplish a given task , but the answer doesn't necessarily showcase the easiest way to do it ( just a way to do it ) because it doesn't leverage functions in the framework that are meant to be used for that purpose - books help issues like this .i always like visiting wufoo whenever i need some form inspiration .at one time it was 800px ;however , more and more sites are beginning to use 1000px .but , above all else , know your audience as @ warren suggests and capitalize on that .this is driven by the fact that , more often than not , visitors ' low end resolutions are at 1024x768 .just to give some perspective , even the new wave of netbooks with their tiny screen have resolutions of 1024x768 .the additional 24 pixels leaves room for the browser chrome , padding and margins you may want to manipulate , etc .it could be synchronous .hopefully this gives some sort of direction .again , this is a bit general but so is your question .it's indirectly possible to call a php function using javascript .without knowing exactly what you're trying to accomplish , here's what i would suggest :as other people have already mentioned , you're going to want to do some type of request - this doesn't necessarily have to be ajax .think of a car .this is high coupling , but it's not really a bad thing .the control should not need anything from its container page .you could say that a car engine is highly coupled to several other objects .the control should be able to be shared between two different paths - new and edit .the single control could be used to let a user post a new piece of information or edit a new piece of information .think of a user control for a web page that is responsible for allowing users to post , edit , and view some type of information .essentially , coupling is how much a given object or set of object relies on another object or another set of objects in order to accomplish its task .if the control is written in such a way that it needs some type of data from the pages that will contain it , then you could say it's too highly coupled .in order for the engine to start , a key must be inserted into the ignition , turned , gasoline must be present , a spark must occur , pistons must fire , and the engine must come alive .another option for the wamp / lamp stack is aptana studio .prototype or jquery are fine - either one makes ajax ridiculously simple .otherwise , you may wanna stick with windows / iis / php / mysql or sql server .i always try to make sure my development environment mirrors production as much as possible .if this site is as simple as you claim it is , something like notepad + + might be sufficient .if you're going the windows / iis / sql server route , then use some of the microsoft express tools .however , if you're definitely going to be going to ajax route , then i definitely recommend using a library .finally , as far as suggested tools are concerned , find something that fits the bill for what you're developing .assuming that the website you're going to be building is hosted on a wamp stack , then i'd say continue to use that ;secondly , if the user is simply logging in , submitting a form , and is then considered to be done , then using ajax might be overkill ;i could be way off , but if you're building a really simple site , don't spend more time configuring shiny new tools for something that can be done with the existing toolbox you've got .other times , it's not .sometimes , operating directly on the instance data is fine ;since you're referring to instance variables , i'm assuming that you're working in an object-oriented language .when it comes to passing data around a class , it's difficult to say what you're doing is good practice without seeing some code .in my opinion , this is something that comes with experience - you'll develop some intuition as your object-oriented thinking skills improve .to some degree , when to use instance variables , how to define their scope , and when to use local variables is subjective , but there are a couple of rules of thumb you can follow whenever creating your classes .implementing a script like this yourself isn't very difficult .however , these can range anywhere from being free and open source , or very expensive .as @ ryan smith suggested , this greatly depends on the implementation details of the website .assuming that you're keeping track of the users on the website in some form of data store ( typically a backend database ) you could do something like this :i'm sure that there is a off-the-shelf framework offering a storefront application with all the bells and whistles ( such as the types of scripts you are mentioning ) ;you can set this process to repeat at certain intervals so that the pages containing the script are dynamically updated showing a relatively up to date count of the number of users online .i agree with @ annakata that this question needs some more clarification , but here is a very , very basic example of how to setup an onclick event handler for the radio buttons :of course , this does have its disadvantages .this is done iteratively throughout development .some testing is better than no testing , but it could be better .personally , i'm unsure of how you would go about performing tdd for ui's ;however , the team that i am on performs automated simulation tests of our uis .the downside to this is that the simulations are locked into the code representing the case .test-driven development lends itself more to developing code than for developing user-interfaces .basically , we have a suite of simulations that are run every hour on the most recent build of the application .it leaves little room for variance and is basically saying that it expects the user to do exactly this behavior with respect to this feature .these tests perform common actions and verify that certain elements , phrases , dialogs , etc , etc , properly occur based on , say , a set of use cases .there are a few different ways in which tdd is performed , but the preferred way of true tdd is to write your tests first , then write the code to pass the tests .again , these are just my common practices stated in the context of your question .though these are by no means official , the common practices that i follow would result in something like this :the thing with web development , as the nature of your question already shows , is that there are so many ways to do the same thing with the same results .otherwise , hide the division .however , for all intents and purposes , this should help answer your question .if the selected index is that of the ' other reason ' option , then display the message ;setup the onchange event handler for the select box to look at the currently selected index .personally , i'd take it a step further and move the javascript into an external file and just include it in the header of the page ;for example :however , i was wondering if , by definition , this is also considered to be a closure :now , the following code is wiring up a callback for the onreadystatechange property of the request object ;again , this is a contrived example that i'm using in hopes of simply demonstrating the point of my question .in javascript , i know that a closure is can be defined as a nested function that has access to its containing function's variables .i realize that the handleresponse function could also just be written as an anonymous function in the context of submithandler , but i find that more complex ajax code can be more readable and easily maintained if callbacks are defined outside the scope of the function calling back to them .for all browsers , save for ie6 , do this :i know you mentioned not wanting to use javascript , but as for ie6 , it's been my experience that you may have to resort to some sort of javascript expression in the css to get it to work as smoothly as this css does in other browsers .try to build it .it's about doing stuff .you gotta write code an you've gotta write a lot of it .i'd argue that , at some point , it's no longer about topics .even more so , if you find your self wondering hey , how does [ this application ] do that ? !you never know , though , one of those little hobby projects may end up solving a problem for someone .people will often tell you to find some niche problem to try and solve when learning a new language and that's perfectly fine , but if there's an application or feature of an application that you really enjoy using or really admire , attempt to build it ( or parts of it ) yourself .many of your projects may never see the light of day beyond your desktop , but the learning , experience , and tools you'll have under your belt will be something that you can carry over to each subsequent project .this should do what you want , and should work across the major browsers :essentially , here's how i ended up having to fix the problem .anyway , it's not as elegant as i would like but it gets the job done .first , i verified that my server-side code was returning the proper content type :after that , i performed a check to see which browser was currently accessing the page :i was able to fix this , but it required a little bit of ie-specific code in order to get it working problem .in order to have more control over the ajax request , i opted to go with jquery's $ . ajax function rather than the $ . get function .specifically , the error i get is :the database column has the data type specified as xml .unfortunately , i've been unsuccessful during my first few attempts .i'm new to asp . net mvc and linq , so i know that i'm missing something .i'm currently working on a small web application using visual studio 2008 express .assuming that i've already got a reference to the data context object , here is the basics of what it is that i'm attempting to do :in addition to the answer , i'm also curious as to why it's impossible to simply save the xml as-is without any additional processing .i'm attempting to retrieve an xml document from a server using a client library and then save the document into a database column ( using linq ) .document . write ( ) doesn't work with xhtml .it's executed after the page has finished loading and does nothing more than write out a string of html .since the actual in-memory representation of html is the dom , the best way to update a given page is to manipulate the dom directly .the way you'd go about doing this would be to programmatically create your nodes and then attach them to an existing place in the dom .for [ purposes of a contrived ] example , assuming that i've got a div element maintaining an id attribute of " header , " then i could introduce some dynamic text by doing this :developers argue about the security of eval ( ) .however , this isn't to say that there aren't many other uses .there's obviously going to be a performance hit for using the function .also , the results of eval ( ) are generally slower because the code has not yet been compiled nor cached .the arguments passed to the function are passed to the javascript compiler after which the code is executed .eval ( ) provides access to the javascript compiler and this ultimately allows for code to be executed at a later time .it is less secure , but if you're absolutely sure your input is sanitized before passing it along , then it shouldn't be a problem .in terms of web development , one of the current most popular uses of eval ( ) is to deserialize a json string usually in the context of ajax applications ;it's also difficult to debug code that results from the use of eval ( ) because there is little-to-no contextual information ( think line numbers ) about the code that is ultimately executed .edit :it works fine in firefox ;here's the basic setup of the ajax request :as requested , here's a fragment of the relevant xml :however , in chrome , i am getting an empty string for the title element .for what it's worth , here's the php script that's grabbing data from the feed .i'm using curl because i'm making the request across domains ( and because it was a quick and dirty solution for the problem at hand ) .i'm using jquery to setup an ajax request that grabs an xml feed from a php script and then parses some information out of the feed and inserts it into the dom .the xml data is being returned correctly and i can see the values of the sibling nodes in chrome ( such as id ) , but , for whatever reason , i continue to get an empty string for the title node .edit march 9thedit march 13thresults in the following error :to my knowledge , everything looks as expected .ruby is at 1 . 9 . 2p0 and rails is at 3 . 0 . 3 .the sample dump of my test directory is as follows :however , this revealed an issue with activesupport .so looking into the file listed above , i see the following :the action pack gems appear to be properly installed and up to date :case in point , attempting to run the test auto-generated by rails fails :but as you can see above , action pack is all installed and update to date .xavier holt ' s suggestion , explicitly specifying the path to the test_helper worked ;now when i attempt to run the test , i receive the following error message ( as also listed above ) :commenting out the require ' test_helper ' line and attempting to run the test results in this error :when attempting to run tests using rake test : units the following stack trace is dumped to the console :i've never seen this problem before - i've run the typical rake tasks for preparing the test environment .i'm working on writing simple unit tests for a rails 3 project , but i'm unable to actually execute any tests .i have nothing out of the ordinary in my application or environment configuration files , nor have i installed any unusual gems that would interfere with the test environment .you shouldn't need a plugin for this .assuming that your logo has the id of logo , the css would be :since it appears you're using jquery , you can do something like this :css can keep the logo fixed and you can use javascript to change the display of the element once the user begins to scroll the page .for example ( the styles are just for example ) . . .if , on the other hand , you're using jquery , then you should be able to use :maxym's answer also provides a solid implementation of getelementsbyclassname for older browsers .using vanilla javascript , you'll probably need to load up all of the element's by tag name and then locate it by evaluating each element's classname .note however that in both of these examples , all cells that have the droppedrow class name will receive this styling ( rather than just a single element ) .if you're not using a library , i'd say stick with the vanilla variant of this functionality - libraries would be too much overhead just to condense this to a single line .to do this :all of this information will be sent across the wire in plaintext .all of this is contingent upon properly and securely registering a user .the typical way to go about building out an authentication system would be :this is possibly the most insecure way to implement authentication in a web application .you're also always lowercasing the user's information so credentials are becoming even less secure .the thing is , implementing something like this varies widely depending on the platform that you're using .as far as evaluating this on the client side , the closest you'll be able to get to client-side validation is using ajax to prevent a page refresh .in all future logins attempts , you'll want to evaluate the users incoming information against the records stored in the database table by passing it through the same hash and salt .i'd prefer to use a multi-select box - not checkboxes .in the contact's new view , i have the following collection_select :is there a better helper available for this particular relationship ?this works , but seems overly complicated for creating a multi-select box for this relationship .i have two models - contacts and organizations - setup in a has_and_belongs_to_many relationship :for example :then they remain on said url ./ images , / styles , / fonts .that is , if the user navigates to :in any other case , i'd like to perform a 301 redirect .whenever someone navigates to the old domain , i'd like the landing page to load .the old domain is a simple landing page that consists of an index . html page and three directories :unfortunately , i can't quite seem to nail the proper regular expression to handle the initial cases for the landing page .i'm working to migrate an entire site to a new server and need to setup htaccess so that it properly redirects old content while handling new content , too .note also that window . open ( ) is a function on the window object itself whereas window . location is an object that exposes a variety of other methods and properties .you may want to do a check prior to running any logic :additionally , not all browsers implement event ( or e ) the same way .the previous answer is fine , but i'm one of those guys that's firmly against mixing behavior with presentation ( putting javascript in my html ) so i prefer to put my event handling logic in my javascript files .i don't think that most developers specify a doctype and then explicitly fail to adhere to it .though i believe in striving for valid xhtml and css , it's often hard to do for a number of reasons .you'd also need a reference to the currently active / selected item .each time keyup or keydown is fired , update the reference to the active / selected item in the data structure .you may also want to see about attaching event handlers in the javascript rather than doing so in an html attribute .to provide highlighting information on the ui , add or remove a class name that is styled via css based on if the item is active / selected or not .off the top of my head , i would think that you'd need to maintain some form of a data structure in the javascript that reflects the items in the current dropdown list .also , this isn't a biggy , but innerhtml is not really standard ( look into createtextnode ( ) , createelement ( ) , and appendchild ( ) for standard ways of creating data ) .for the most part , i don't use them ;that's why i don't like partial classes .with that said , i'm on the fence about regions .to that end , i don't believe that something with a clear responsibility should be split across multiple files .i'm not a fan of partial classes - i try to develop my classes such that each class has a very clear , single issue for which it's responsible .however , i work with code every day that includes regions - some people go really heavy on them ( folding up private methods into a region and then each method folded into its own region ) , and some people go light on them ( folding up enums , folding up attributes , etc ) .my general rule of thumb , as of now , is that i only put code in regions if ( a ) the data is likely to remain static or will not be touched very often ( like enums ) , or ( b ) if there are methods that are implemented out of necessity because of subclassing or abstract method implementation , but , again , won't be touched very often .@ grant is right .it's worked out pretty well for us .we have versions of the files in the repository that are pulled with each check out but they don't change .i'm on a team with close to 100 other developers , and our config files are not checked into source control .similar to abyx , in the team i am on developers always use unit testing and code reviews .it's much easier to go back later and introduce methods , attributes , and properties for which are asked versus anticipating something that may never come .i've found that incorporating methods that may never be used , but provide functionality can unintentionally introduce a " backdoor " or unintended / unanticipated use into the system .in addition to that , i also aim to make sure that i don't incorporate code that people may use - i tend to write code only for the basic set of methods required for the object at hand to function as has been spec'd out .ideally , i'd like the tool ( or set of tools , even ) :this isn't a necessity - if i need to do so , i can write one myself ;however , i'd figure i'd poll the community first to see if something already exists .what's the best , free tool for benchmarking a script such as this across the major browsers ?because this has potential to be a very expensive task , i'd like to benchmark the performance of this script .if possible , i'd also like the tool to generate varying levels of complex pages so that i can stress test a set of doms .i'm currently working on a javascript tool that , during the course of its execution , will ultimately traverse each node in the dom .either way , hopefully this helps .i don't know if you're using a framework or not , but here's a possible solution using prototype :similar to what pkaeding said , it's hard to guess the problem without seeing your markup and script ;however , i'd venture to say that you're not properly stopping the event propagation and / or you're not properly hiding the existing element .of course , this could be generalized further by getting all of the elements with , say , the same class , iterating through them , and applying the same event handling function to each of them .instead , i'm finding that a set of concise , cohesive functions are working well .i'm currently building a small web application that includes a fair amount of javascript .now that i'm getting into the implementation phase , i'm finding that creating object-oriented javascript for the sake of being object-oriented seems overkill - the project isn't likely to require any major modifications in the future that would warrant and object-oriented design .when i was prototyping the initial idea , i just hacked together a few functions to demonstrate how the application would eventually behave intending to go forward re-writing the javascript in an object-oriented nature .so , with that said and with attempting to adhere to the kiss principle , when a set of functions are providing a suitable solution to a problem , are there any other reasons worth considering to convert my code into an object-oriented design ?i digress = ) .for example , if you're writing code that appears like this :above all else , know that douglas crockford recommends not using with .i urge you to check out his blog post regarding with and its alternatives here .
