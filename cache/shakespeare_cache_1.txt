Very well.He's coming.The people's enemy is gone, is gone!With old Menenius, and those senatorsThat always favour'd him.
I have; 'tis ready.List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!                    [They all shout and throw up their caps]
Worthy tribunes,There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports the Volsces with several powers
Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.
