the optimal solution would be one where i didn't have to pass a single xmlwriter instance as a parameter to each component .the difference is :i decided the best approach would be to use domdocument instead .domdocument does not generate any xml until you output , whereas xmlwriter is basically a stringbuilder and is not as flexible .i've never actually seen anyone combine xmlwriter objects this way and i don't think it is very efficient for what i am trying to do .here is a full sample :this is two separate requests being seeded with the request_time , which means array_rand will return the same value both times .instead of passing variables from the page to the image , you could set the random number generator seed to the same value on both scripts .edit :updating the syntax to the following , solved the problem :ok , sorry to answer my own question but i figured out the solution shortly after posting this .i most likely have a different version of urlrewriter . net than what was used when these rules were created .i was able to confirm that our production environment was using intelligencia . urlrewriter version 1 . 7 . 0 but the assembly i was using was 2 . 0 .? :source :<URL> # 5 . 3 . 0there is a new operator in php 5 . 3 which does this :it can happen if you do this inside test ( ) :i doubt you are though , maybe you can update your post to provide a code sample that better resembles your situation .in vb i am able to do this :what would be the equivalent of this in c # ?there is a contains ( ) extension method on ienumerable ;this should re-index the array while preserving string keys :the idea is to use separate classes to distinguish between strings .i don't know what these strings you are formatting actually represent , so i used generic naming on these classes :<URL><URL><URL> . . .geoplanet service .according to the yahoo !get the woeid from a zip code :get the weather info using woeid :i couldn't find any documentation on this .the woeid can be obtained by using the yahoo !is it safe to use in a production application ?if i have a zip code , this is two api calls to obtain weather information .however , after some web crawling i found that you can do the exact same thing with one api call :weather api documentation , a woeid must be provided to obtain weather information for a specific region .: )in this situation , i usually create a dynamically generated xml file and pass the url to it as a flashvar .however , if your flash app is very simple and you don't plan on adding many arrays / relationships to it then ignore my answer .the reason i prefer xml is that i hate having to write extra javascript which encodes the flashvars and then extra actionscript to parse them .environment is asp . net , iis6 / iis7 , vs . net .however , i have not seen them used in web applications before .i see that junctions are a common way of referencing shared code in many projects .is it more appropriate to use junctions or virtual directories on web application projects ?my goal is to compile a list of pros and cons in order to make an informed decision regarding this change .our team is exploring the possibility of abandoning virtual directories in favor of junctions to simplify our build process .example :do you have to use tabindex to do this ?one button goes back , and one goes forward .let's say you create a wizard in an html form .that way , when you press enter the wizard will move to the next page , not the previous .what i would like to do , is get to decide which button is used to submit the form when a user presses enter .since the back button appears first in the markup when you press enter it will use that button to submit the form .edit :notes :output :you could use an observer pattern .a simple functional way to accomplish this :i can re-post this code when this bug gets fixed .nevermind , it only appears that way when you are editingthis is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in php .sorry , it appears underscore characters are replaced by html entities by markdown ?i've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin .there are better alternatives , i suggest you check out the wordpress documentation for more information .the hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook .for this example source code , you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable .add this to one of these files :i usually just specify this in an . htaccess file or the vhost . conf on the domain i'm working on .personally , i find chm to be excellent .is the question how to generate your own help files , or what is the best help file format ?so when i press f1 it loads the chm and performs a search for the word my cursor is on ( great for quick function reference ) .one of the first things i do when setting up a machine is to download the php manual in chm format ( <URL> ) and add a hotkey to it in crimson editor .also i would try :but i don't have air installed so i can't really test this . . .has anyone else had this experience ?is there possibly a linux shell equivalent for windows ?as a lamp developer considering moving to a . net iis platform , one of my concerns is the loss of productivity due to lack of shell . . .here are the basic steps :in case i missed anything .and finally , the source code .this will move it to the dicecontainer below .it may not be done the best way however , but it may be a good starting point for you .edit 8 / 6 - if it wasn't apparent from the images , each die is a button you can click .looking at the source code you can see that each die button is drawn dynamically , based on its value .i haven't experimented too much with this but , depending on the layout you use for your gui your button could look completely different .the amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getpreferredsize ( ) , assuming getminimumsize ( ) and getmaximumsize ( ) return the same value .when i was first learning java we had to make yahtzee and i thought it would be cool to create custom swing components and containers instead of just drawing everything on one jpanel .the benefit of extending swing components , of course , is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint ( ) method print a pretty picture .i use recursion .common uses i have found :( which i don't , by the way )what does that have to do with having a cs degree . . .try __file__ .you can use relative paths .so , in soap . php , you could do :this is a php constant which always returns the path / filename of the script it is in .another solution would be to set an include path in your httpd . conf or an . htaccess file .try adding a path .the following code works for me :random . org has an api you can access via http .as others have mentioned , i would analyze your conditionals to see if there's a way you can outsource it to other methods to increase readability .<URL> # 77679here's a snippet from the php . net docs that i've used in a project and works fine :i wouldn't know for sure without testing but try placing this between the table and the fieldset :for you . . .most wysiwyg editors also insert & nbsp ;you can use a styled pre block to preserve whitespace .overall , it's good that the browser ignores whitespace .just view the source on this website for yourself and imagine how crazy the site would look if every space was displayed .from that , you can regex to your heart's content .good suggestion , alternatively you can execute a curl request for each address to google maps and it will return the properly formatted address .i've tried to do this several times with no luck .so can anyone tell me why the following doesn't work ?after reading this post , it made me interested in doing this again .most servers have this enabled .plain html is great , gives you the most control .it basically let's you attach one file to many pages .if you want to make updating a bit easier though , you could use ssi .that way you wouldn't have to update this one file on every page each time you need to update .for example , you could have your menu in navigation . html and every page would include this file .feel free to edit this question / title , i know it doesn't really make sense .i thought . net code gets compiled into msil , so i always wondered how do yellow screens produce the faulty code .if it's executing the compiled code , how is the compiler able to produce code from the source files in the error message ?i would just save a copy to your server , and edit to your needs .as chris said , you don't have to use the exact css they provide religiously .you can do :for example , instead of this :this elaborates on my previous answer .you can keep the color declared in one spot by doing this .if you find that you need to use a css hack there is probably a better way to do it .once you use css enough you should be able to overcome most browser inconsistencies easily .but as i started to use it more and more , i developed a different style to overcome these issues .when i first started using css i also thought it was a pain that it didn't support variables , expressions , etc .ctrl + w to close tabsi'm trying to bind the following shortcut :how can you customize vs to add / change shortcuts ?also , what are the most useful shortcuts you guys have found ?$ this is a reference to the current object .mainclass . vbtestclass . vbis this a feature of vb ?or do other languages do this as well ?these files are in the app_code directory .just curious , because i've never thought of doing this before , nor have i read about it anywhere .i've seen some code where a class is imported , instead of a namespace , making all the static members / methods of that class available .thanks .the issue we are running into is this :my knowledge of relays is very limited .user - { 0 } @ aol . com ( replace { 0 } with an id )our host ( godaddy ) limits smtp relays to 250 per day .this format is not likely to change for various reasons .this way we can track what user we sent the message to originally .every email we send out with a dynamic address is creating a new smtp relay .this is an application that potentially will be sending out thousands of emails per day .if so , are there any services or hosts that provide unlimited relays for a reasonable price ?is my assumption that every ' unregistered ' email address we use opens a new relay , correct ?we have set up a system where notifications get sent to a user with the following from address format :datetime . now will not work , use datetime . today instead .if you use pdo or the mysqli class you can use paramaterized or prepared queries .if you are familiar with writing web apps in php , you already know how to write console apps with it .the only difference is you are outputting plaintext instead of html , and some new superglobals $ argc and $ argv which contain the command line arguments .working with the db probably would be just as easy in either language , so for your app the main thing you will have to decide is which language do you feel more comfortable manipulating data with ?it's useful for polymorphism and finding bugs at compile time .it's only " redundant " if you are comparing it to dynamically typed languages .also , it makes code auto-complete / intellisense easier for your ide ( if you use one ) .no need for loops or arrays :thanks .i need to generate a list of sequential numbers .anything like that in . net already , or do i have to write it ?i know ruby you can do 1 . . 10 or php you can do range ( 1 , 10 ) .thanks .thanks .example :drawing this :would generate :original question :if anybody knows of a program such as this , let me know .alex explained what i'm looking for much better than i have :is there any simple graphics editor ( like mspaint ) which generates source code ?i've been working with java and custom drawing using the java . awt . graphics library lately , but find it is taking too much time to write manually .note :is there anything like this for vb projects ?in c # adding event handler methods is very easy .you just type " object . event + = " and then press tab twice .this is for dynamically created controls or controls that are not declared withevents .there may be missing files in your project .this would cause the publish to fail since it cannot publish files that no longer exist .alternatively , you could do this :then in your controller do $ this - > load = new mockloader ( ) .here's a functional alternative which should work the same as the code you posted , but may be a little easier to understand :this has been working out really well so far .for this project i am working on , all views are xsl templates .a really good example of this structure is the wow armory website ( view the source ) .it's also a standard template language which is very flexible and has tons of documentation .i like this structure because i can keep all my templates in one file , and arrange them anyway i want .instead of passing variables to the view , i generate all the xml in the controller and transform it with the view .edit :here's a method which may suit your needs .these are then registered using your existing url routing class .however , this would require a change to your existing framework . . .i was just thinking , the urlroute class should probably also contain a field for classname .the interface contains a single method which expects an array of urlroute objects to be returned .each class that contains routes must implement an interface and then later loop through all defined classes which implement that interface to collect a list of routes .then $ oroutemanager - > registerroute ( $ urlroute - > route , array ( $ classname , $ urlroute - > method ) ) could be simplified to $ oroutemanager - > registerroute ( $ urlroute ) .outputs :i would suggest something a bit more flexible such as this ( unless the method names are dynamic or are unknown ) :try getting someone to pay you for using it .might be harder if you want to learn python casually . . .we had absolutely no idea what we were doing at the time , but it was a great learning experience .my advice would be to try something new when you get the chance , make mistakes , and continue to learn .now , this application should have been a web application , but we had a unique opportunity to try something new .my company was contracted to build a web application last year , and the client specified that it should be done in flex .i am trying to read data from an rss feed which has 25 items .i've tried rss feeds from other subreddits as well with the same result .when i request the rss file through http it says there are only 20 items .<URL>i see what the issue is now . . .i resolved the issue by appending the sort order query string to the request url :the first option is " rising " which only shows up-and-coming entries , the alternate sort order is " new " .since i chose the " new " sort order in my browser it saved a cookie and was used as the default sort order afterwards .however , accessing the page through code was still using the default sort order , which returned a variable amount of results .if you visit a sub-reddit like / r / programming / and go to the " new " tab to see newest submissions , there are two sorting options .to traverse a directory of xml files you can just do :i also recommend you make a minor adjustment to your code so simplexml doesn't need to parse the same file four times to get the properties you need :i think jspcal had the best answer so far .the only modification i made to his code was to use a do-while loop instead , so it would not skip the element where first loop breaks .here's a basic example :if you must keep it , michael's solution looked good .as far as optimizing the inner loop , i would just delete that code .i would change the code to use dedicated structures instead of arrays .this is more of a general suggestion for all the code , not just the inner loop .either come up with a new ui element for having multiple users in the same location , or ignore a user if their lat / long has already been added to the map .a few problems i am facing :here are example api calls i would use in code :is there any standard way of dealing with this situation ?i have an application in vb / c # . net which needs to interact with a third party api , but i would like to interface it out so i can use a mock api for testing purposes .update :just two concerns :the best solutions so far are :i chose xml because it is language neutral .using xml for configuration is not the question .sorry for the misleading original question title .please stop suggesting that i use arrays or ini files . . .i am already using simplexml to parse the config ( partially ) .changed the question title to better reflect what i'm looking for .has anybody else used xml to store configuration for a php project ?i am asking for the best practices when using xml for configuration .this is working fine , but i don't feel like it is the best solution .i want the config file to be as easy as possible to use , even for non php developers .i am also not worried about compiling or making it faster because that can be achieved using memcached or other utilities .the best way i could think to prevent it from being served is to change the filetype to php and add the following comment :i was planning to use an xml document to store configuration for my next php project , in a format similar to asp . net web . config files .what are some good alternate solutions ( instead of putting a comment at the beginning of the file which exits the script if a constant is not defined ) ?i would like to hear from someone who has experience using xml for configuration settings in an application , and how they prevent the config file from being served .take a look at this code i came up with .it should be exactly what you're looking for , although it may require you to change your existing code structure .i should have phrased my question better .the best solutions so far are to move the file out of web root or use use htaccess .i already decided not to do either of these before posting here , i should have mentioned that as well .nobody has said anything bad about using a exit statement at the top of the xml file so i guess i will keep doing that , for now .i wasn't looking for alternatives to an xml config solution i was looking for alternatives to the way i prevent the config file from being served .any ideas ?here's the code i have so far :it seems to be ignoring the templatecontrol property completely .i am trying to create a more detailed item template for the standard checkboxlist control .it exposes an itemplate property called templatecontrol but i wasn't able to find a straightforward resource on how to actually use it .is there a way to automate this ?then we create a build with only the files that have changed .for example , if we need to update a client website , we only want to send the files that have changed .then i have to manually add all the changed / added files to a temporary folder before copying it to production .when creating partial builds for a project , i usually diff the project folder latest revision against a production label .currently , to determine the difference between their current production website and what we have in source control , we diff against two different labels on the website folder .however , i ran into several issues .if i fix the xmlns it throws the exception :i am trying to read data from an ms project xml file .my question is , has anybody encountered this situation before ?if i try to deserialize with the incorrect xmlns it throws an exception :are there better alternatives to parsing ms project xml ( besides interop ) ?the xmlns property on the root node from the xml exported from ms project does not match the xsd schema .i have used the xml schema tool to generate a set of strongly typed classes based on the microsoft project 2007 xml schema .so it appears that either the xml schema utility did not correctly generate the classes , or the microsoft project 2007 xml schema is incorrect .possible solution . . .however , valid values are within the range 1-3 .i imported the xml into ms project and exported it as xml .the generated xml did not set the < fixedcostaccrual > element for each task .ms project set the < fixedcostaccrual > value to 0 for each task when i exported .i'm still not sure why it generates the xml with the wrong xmlns attribute though .the data i was trying to deserialize was serialized from another component in the same application .not sure why ms project would set the default value to something outside the range , but the solution was to fix the component which generates the output xml .edit :mysql rand ( ) accepts a seed as an optional argument .using a seed , it will return the same randomized result set each time .sorry , i didn't realize the solution was posted already but was deleted .what you could do is generate a random seed in php on the first page request and pass it along to each page using a query string .you could create a new table with a one to many association to group repairs by order .wherever you want to include the list module just create a new paths configuration which points to the optimized file .the api is designed to work with single page applications .the tealeaf uic creates a single global variable called tlt which you can easily shim .<URL> # inlineblocksome browsers also support inline-blocks .as mentioned , display : inline is probably what you want .expression engine is fantastic .it's free to download and try but you must purchase a license if you are making a profit with it .any ideas ?i'm having an issue getting the following syntax to work :as noted , the first rule does nothing no matter what i try .the issue is that i don't have any ideas why the first rewrite rule would not execute .the x-powered-by field on the response for that page request always says " asp . net " .i believe that iis is configured properly because it is handling the request correctly for < redirect / > .i have tried to search the documentation on urlrewriter . net , but at this time , it seems their site if offline or no longer in service .however , the second rewrite rule always works , and the x-powered-by field on the response for that request is " asp . net , urlrewriter . net 2 . 0 " .here's another way you could do it :@ ryanthis code has been tested :that's correct but it actually makes the tags with the least number , larger .this isn't much better :i agree with leac .it's really interesting .it's a pretty fun visual way of looking at code .i actually play with scratch sometimes if i'm bored .how it works is , they give you a bunch of " blocks " ( these look like legos ) which you can stack .not only that , but you can download any submission on the website , and learn from or extend other scratch applications .when it's complete you can upload it right to the scratch websites , which is a youtube-ish portal for scratch applications .and by stacking these blocks , and interacting with the canvas ( where you put your sprites , graphics ) , you can create games , movies , slideshows . . .url's ?as in images / scripts / css / etc . ?also , are there trade offs for using these ?i'd like to know if using either of these makes php comparable to faster web-technologies .does anybody have experience working with php accelerators such as mmcache or zend accelerator ?a list apart uses ror , not very enterprise-y though .i can imagine , they are the ones who invented it after all .standalone games in gwt :you can define multiple autoloading functions with spl_autoload_register :what does the following mean ?what is this operator called , and what does it do ?edit :original :mainclass . vbtestclass . vbis this a feature of vb ?vb . net importing classesthis was accidentally posted twice .or do other languages do this as well ?these files are in the app_code directory .just curious , because i've never thought of doing this before , nor have i read about it anywhere .i've seen some code where a class is imported , instead of a namespace , making all the static members / methods of that class available .is this possible ?the following code throws errors :if not , what are the alternatives ?i am trying to do the following in asp . net 3 . 5 .basically , i am binding a linqdatasource to a datalist .there is a property called " deleted " and if it is true , i want to display different markup .use :much thanks !can anybody tell me what this means ?i'm still learning asp . net and i often see code like this throughout parts of our framework :here's one way of doing it :in . net i would probably create some events and handle them .ori'm using ms sql server . . .is this even possible in sql ?to give more context to the situation :these scripts are fairly large and were designed to be run independently .in java you can do the following to locally scope variables within a method :in my current situation , this may really come in handy with this sql project .sometimes , we need to run several of these scripts together and deliver in a single file .we have several sql scripts stored as files which help perform various operations on a database .i don't even know what the name for this technique is , i've only needed to use it once or twice .since most of these script have common variables we run into a conflict when joining these scripts together .of course , it is easy to move all variable declaration to the beginning of the file , but the goal is to have this process automated .i usually create a separate controller to handle ajax requests .alternatively , you could just pass in a querystring with each ajax request such as :i like this approach because it reminds me to keep my application logic and ui building logic separate .for example , / ajax / getusers / ? page = 2 may return the html for page two of a paginated users grid .www . domain . com / controller / method / ? ajax = 1 and then hide your layout components when this is present .update :is there a better way to structure my application ?does it make sense to combine xmlwriter objects like this ?i may abandon xmlwriter altogether and use domdocument instead .below , is a simplified code sample of the application structure .it is more flexible and it also seemed to perform better ( at least on the crude tests i created ) .the way my application is structured , each component generates output as xml and returns an xmlwriter object .before rendering the final output to the page , i combine all xml and perform an xsl transformation on that object .
