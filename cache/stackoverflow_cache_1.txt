this chart scales from 0 to 1357 .i need to make a chart with an optimized y axis maximum value .i need to have calculated the proper value of 1400 , problematically .it has the same spacing between grid lines , but there are more of them .so here's the steps to just-about copy what excel does to make charts all fancy .alt text <URL> there were between 12003 and 14003 inbound calls so far in february .i'd like to avoid charts that look like a monkey came up with the y - axis numbers .using the google charts api helps a little bit , but it's still not quite what i want .i've updated these with static images , but some of the answers refrence different values .i'm throwing in rbobby ' s defanition of a ' nice ' number here because it explains it so well .with a value of 26 , the chart's height is 30 , with grid lines at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 .fist , mark ransom's code determines the optimum spacing between ticks , when given the number of ticks .the numbers are clean , but the top of the y value is always the same as the maximum value on the chart .with a value of 23 , the height of the chart goes to 25 , with a grid line at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 .alt text <URL> i found the way to get the results that i want using a modified version of mark ransom's idea .what i'm doing is i'm running mark's code with 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 grid lines ( ticks ) to find which of those is the lowest .sometimes this number ends up being more than twice what the highest value on the chart is , depending on how many grid lines you want .the current method i have of making charts simply uses the maximum value of all the graphs , then divides it by ten , and uses that as grid lines .as soon as i fixed the code , my dynamic graphs started working , making this question nonsensical ( because the examples no longer had any errors in them ) .does your kiosk have a keyboard ?most kiosks don't so that won't be an issue .it still might be possible to alt-tab to the window .instead of minimizing them , just throw them 9000 pixels to the left , and bring them back when needed .if the v or single digit match at the start ( i . e .not ' e ' ) then an extra digit is allowed on the rear .e with one digit , or v , or a single digit , followed by two digits , then the usual decimal stuff .e has to have three non decimal digits , v has to have 2 , and digits by them selves have to have three .my apk uploads now with no modification on my part .it must have been some sort of error on google's end .they fixed the problem on their end after i opened a support ticket .it's javascript code , so that answers that .i have a website that plays mp3s in a flash player .if a user clicks ' play ' the flash player automatically downloads an mp3 and starts playing it .however , it would be nice to know how to track downloads using the other method ( without switching hosts ) .is there an easy way to track how many times a particular song clip ( or any binary file ) has been downloaded ?the following works for me in firefox and internet explorer :with perl you can surround the data you want with ( ) ' s and pull it out later , perhaps other languages have a similar feature .wow , that took forever .ok , here's what i've ended up withno one try it in idle , unless you have task manager handy .it fails hard using idle , the python . . . thing . . . that comes with python .i've already forgotten how i lived with menus that arn't super-instant responsive .but once i tried it in dos ( er , cmd . exe ) , as a real program , then it ran fine .likecan you do some rudimentary string function to force javascript into changing it into a string ?edit :i recede my suggestion .it's easy to create really subtle chart effects .scratch that , open-flash-chart looks way better .pie charts fading in one slice at a time looks fairly professional without being annoying .i can vouch that i've had good experiences with php / swf charts ( and by extension , the xml / swf charts too ) .save ) your work every day .with version control , you never have to make copies of " safe " builds .at my current job , my predecessor did not use any kind of version control .needless to say , i installed version control the day after i found out it existed .also , tortoisesvn makes committing to the database as easy as right clicking a folder .there are just mountains of folders in at least 3 different places where he kept all of his projects .any random project folder can be expected to find at least one folder name " project ( old ) " and one named " project "you don't really have to worry about your ide corrupting the file you're working on ( i'm looking at you , realbasic 5 . 5 ) because is so easy to commit ( read :for wget :your status page is available now without logging in ( click logout and try it ) .when the beta-cookie is disabled , there will be nothing between you and your status page .and for wget :from mark harrisonyou probably have as much already , but i think this is what you are trying to do :i say , if it renders ok , then it doesn't matter if it's pixel perfect .browsers aren't going to drop support for error correction anytime in the near future .now , i'm not saying you should built sloppy web pages , but i see no reason to fix what ain't broke .it takes a while to get a site up and running the way you want it , going back and making changes is going to change the way the page renders slightly , then you have to fix those problems .update :pros to clickonce :downsides to clickonce :does windows installer do these things as well ?it was nice because it supported the three things i ( eventually ) needed .i've never really used anything else , so i'm not sure what my options are .generally when i use clickonce when i build a vb . net program but it has a few downsides .i know it dosen't have any of the clickonce cons , but it would be nice to know if it also has the clickonce pros .i ended up using wix 2 ( wix 3 was available but at the time i did the project , no one had a competent tutorial ) .an optional start-up-with-windows shortcut , a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option , and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option .whitepages . com has an api that will allow developers to reverse lookup a phone number .i don't know of any free sms services , you usually buy bulk sms'seses and use an api to send them out .it reports the carrier on mobile number , however a lot of the time it's some non-existent-anymore carrier like powertel or something .all http's and mailto'sall links , including relative ones , that are called by href or src .the second one will only get you links that use double quotes , however .the wb in open ( ' test . mp3 ' , ' wb ' ) opens a file ( and erases any existing file ) in binary mode so you can save data with it instead of just text .' syou might have to convert any < ' s to & lt ;use the < pre > tag ( pre formatted ) , that will use a mono spaced font ( for your art ) and keep all the white spaceyou mean change the text file before it's committed ?what i would do is block the commit ( non zero exit ) , and give an error message as to why you don't want that revision to go through .you can ( i'm not sure how ) , but it's generally not a good idea , as it doesn't tell the client about the change , so the local copies become void on a commit .is there any way to either :there are times when i need to diagnose our hardware .vb . net preferably , but i'll take a language agnostic answer as well .third party companies write software that communicates with our hardware .i don't know the name of this application / service and it's not always the same one .the company i work for makes hardware that communicates to the computer though a serial port .however , a third party software app connects to the serial port when windows starts up , blocking any other connection .it's about halfway though the article .in the article , the guy says to do this every day .the part you'll want to read is titled " waiter , there's a bug in my trunk ! " .the article here ( day-to-day with subversion ) mentions that one method is to constantly update version 2 with data from the version 1 . 1 build .drag the exported copy ( which is the latest copy ) over the 7450 copy .all the new files should simply overwrite the older ones , leaving the . svn folders the same .subversion will assume you just made a bunch of changes to 7450 , and the next checkin will set it as 7451 .you could check out a rev . 7450 copy somewhere , then export your 7500 copy ( to remove the . svn folders ) .if you can put a & nbsp ;or do you require a pure css solution ?( non-breaking space ) to fill the void , that will usually work .if i recall , the cell dosn't exist in some ie's unless it's filled with something . . .apparently , ie8 shows the cells by default , and you have to hide it with empty-cells : hide but it doesn't work at all in ie7 ( which hides by default ) .i have a huge database with no ( separate ) index .any time i query by the primary key the results are , for all intensive purposes , instant .' s ahead of timethat will preserve line breaks and spaces .< code > seems to just use a monospaced font .you might be looking for the < pre > tag ( for pre formatted ) .i think the < code > tag is more for displaying with a certain font , rather than layout .unless the code you are trying to display is html code itself , then i think you'd have to change all the < ' s to & lt ;if it's something you want to do , take the money .don't do something you don't want to do just for money .if very large bags of money are involved , preferably with a large dollar sign printed on the sides , that overrules everything else .for wix 2 you can use & feature to find out if that feature is installed or not :this way , you can hide the dialog and use the same condition to not launch the program ( regardless of the initial state of the check box ) .that will matchbut not the cn = or the , on either side .if your regex supports lookaheads and lookbehinds then you can usethe comma and cn = still have to be there for the match , it just isn't included in the result .i have a highlighter code on my site and this workshave you tried elhightlight . style . background = " " ; ?then bam .a firefox window pops on your desktop .it's not remote desktop , but it's close .if you have a linux machine you can use , then ssh - x will allow you to start gui programs .i think so , yes .when i use the setup project , i have to explicitly reference project a's primary output and content files , as well as all of project b's dll files .if the dns record is set up to allow for infinite subdomains , then you could connect to for website a and for website b .if you are accessing the ftp server via dns ( as opposed to an ip address ) you can probably use a subdomain that points to the same ftp server .i do not have visual web developer so i can't test this , but firefox could not tell that ftp : / / 1 . example . com was the same as ftp : / / 2 . example . comvisual web developer should assume that ftp servers on , what appears to be , different servers would belong to different web sites when in fact only the folder is different .here is my xfer . phpand left click in firefox .and the page that links to xfer . php isi've recently tested it for right clicking .i'm using a php middle-man to log file downloads .a url formatted <URL> results in the file name for both save as . . .with $ key being the file name and songs being the folder that the filenames are kept in .this answer details how to use a transfer page to log the download as well as the start downloading the file as soon as someone clicks the link .all you can do it explain to your customer that they hired you for your expertise in design , but at the end of the day , the customer is always right .if you find you don't enjoy working for customers like that , simply state at the beginning of a new project that you require complete creative control .if they still want rotating logos , then you'll have to put up with it for that project but at least you can decline any offers from the same customer in the future .edit :delete the log file ?i'm leaving this up to reiterate what not to do .apparently deleting the log file is bad , it's just just a log to sql server .should allow your pages to be entered as www . example . com / page / idmost of your pages will internally look like www . example . com / index . php ? page = text & id = but that shouldn't affect anything .perhaps recaptcha , as it starts to run lower on words that people get correctly , starts paring harder and harder ' unknkown ' words as people filter out all the easy ones ?use keydown insteadtry this one , it was computer generated .use get if you want people to be able to bookmark your page , because all the data is included with the bookmark .you should use post if there is a lot of data , or sort-of sensitive information ( really sensitive stuff needs a secure connection as well ) .just be careful of people hitting refresh with the get method , because the data will be sent again every time without warning the user ( post sometimes warns the user about resending data ) .i'm not positive , but i think you can do the same with wix 3 .that way , all your projects can have their own version of wix with a disk drive hit of only about 4 megs each .i know with wix 2 , you can just download the executable files and the dll's to whatever directory your project is in .then you create a . bat file to run candle . exe and light . exe with the parameters you need to build your installer .: - ): - d: - d ./ opt optional .simple as that .take a peek inside .go upvote that website .respect the dev directory !ldd works with any program .for instance , hd1 , hd2 , etc .each device is treated like a file .neat little tricks arise from this .the file mtab stores cron settings .( cat / dev / video0 > show . mpg ) ./ usr probably my favorite folder in / .are pata hard drives , sd1 , sd2 , etc ./ lib this contains all the system libraries .all of this is copied directly from kdubois . net .look inside and you ll find a bunch of . so files .these are libraries needed by other programs to run ./ dev this contains all the device nodes of the system .hopefully you ll never have to think about this folder .oftentimes , initial ramdisks are also included here also ./ bin this contains system wide , basic binary executables .the / usr / local contains yet another root like directory !/ tmp as you could guess , this folder holds temporary files .be careful when messing with anything in the / etc directory !/ root this is the superuser s ( the root user s ) home folder .any hardware detected by the kernel is placed here as and entry ./ boot this folder contains what is needed to boot up the computer .forcibly removing anything in this directory is highly ill advised .modifying the names of your system libraries will break your system ./ etc this is where the system typically stores system configuration files .descend into / usr and you will find a bunch of folders much like you see in / .your graphical x server keeps all its configuration within the x11 / directory ./ proc this is a mission critical folder that you probably shouldn t screw with ./ var this folder contains important files that contain system state information .for instance , the error log for your graphical server is contained in this folderare scsi drives , ram is the system ram , and video0 is usually some sort of tv tuner .if you re on a debian system , the files to configure apt are withing the apt / directory .grub then takes what its been told about the system and jump starts the kernel into booting .basic tools for things like decompressing files or navigating directories are contained here .the kernel uses this to organize processes s ( running programs , more or less ) information .there are tons of other system settings in this folder , so try to learn about them if you can .strictly speaking , every item in / dev is not a physical component of the system , but most are .programs won t know where to look when they need to access critical components located in libraries .the kernel handles the actual steps necessary for making the device process the data like it should ./ home this is where all the directories and files containing information specific to one user reside .if you re curious about this , type ldd / bin / echo ( echo is a simple utility for outputting text ) .this notion is familiar to veteran open source guys , but an odd concept to new converts from windows .each user of the system should be granted a directory within / home that matches the name of that user .for instance , i can cat / dev / video0 ( my hauppauge tv tuner ) and record a tv show with a single command .i m more accustomed to grub , so i ll go into a little depth of how a / boot directory using grub would work ./ lost + found when an ext filesystem has trouble , any files that are orphaned or in trouble are placed here .for instance , cd , ls , ip , cat and other programs that are universal basic linux standards are contained here .likewise , the binaries in / usr / bin are found as easily as / bin because the system knows to look in both paths .the settings for networking , the graphical x server , as well as many other system functions reside in this folder .this removes a huge level of abstraction and makes writing to your graphics card the same as writing your term paper ./ srv a lot of times , this folder is used on web servers to contain information that can be accessed via the internet .a lot of times , system administrators will use this folder to install programs that you want to be easily deleted by hand .pretty much everything links against libc . so . 6 and ld-linux . so . 2 , so renaming this is a sure way to bust your system .your system will return what libraries echo is linked to , namely , ld-linux . so . 2 and libc . so . 6 and linux-gate . so . 1 .in menu . lst , there are specifications for what kernel boot image should be used , as well as what initial ramdisk should be used .normally , programs that are oriented more towards the user and less towards getting the system to operate are installed into / usr .you won t have to worry too heavily about system libraries , as package managers doing a good job about keeping everything in order ./ mnt and / media depending on what system you use , these two folders are where you will mount filesystems other than the / filesystem .compiling code , or helping to develop linux , however , you might run into problems here or there with libraries though , so watch out !this folder is pretty useful in telling if a driver you just compiled is working , and for seeing what your system sees as its hardware .for instance , on my gnome based system here , i installed kde s libraries to / opt so that i can simply easily delete the entire folder .upon boot , the system looks into / boot / grub / menu . lst to try to determine how to boot up whaever system you want for this session .in modern linux systems , this folder is managed largely by udev , which helps with the automatic configuration and population of this directory .minimally it contains a bootloader like grub or lilo ( the menu that pops up at boot and allows you to select the os ) and an image of the kernel ./ sbin a concatenation of system binaries , this folder typically contains higher level system utilities , like ifconfig for network configuration .the system s linker knows to look in both / lib and / usr / lib so any libraries installed into / usr / lib are found just as easily as those in / lib .when compiling software , the default installation will scatter libraries , binaries and configuration files across the directory , so by telling the installer to put everything in / opt , you can still install the program , but you can leave it in a place that you can delete everything at once .looking at ubuntu ( the distro i usually blog from on my laptop ) , whenever you plug a usb memory stick , cd , or a new hard drive , it is mounted under / media directory .the reasons for doing all this might seem a bit vague or arbitrary but are actually incredibly useful if you get down to trying to organize a system or develop new software .gnome or kde are usually installed in this folder , and you will find many of the programs you fire up in daily usage ( like firefox , or evolution , or gedit ) located here .unless you re messing with boot options , you probably won t deal with / boot too often , but its a critical part of a linux system , which is always good to have knowledge about .this is for the same reason as the root like folder in / usr , but is intended for the system administrator to install more permanent programs ( usually ones he compiled personally ) into .if mozilla firefox needs to cache your current download , it could store the partial file in / tmp until it finishes downloading and then copy it out of / tmp to your chosen download location .the reason for this is that the programs can be installed to a root-like set of folders ( like the installer is expecting ) without actually muddling up the / directory with a plethora of files .contained within each user s profile is usually all the files you deal with on a regular basis , your documents , media , and settings are all best placed within your / home / $ username directory .good programs will clean up / tmp themselves when they re done using it , but its contents are automatically deleted upon reboot , so don t worry about this folder ballooning over time until its causing performance issues .the boundary between what goes in / bin and / sbin have always been a little vague to me , but sbin utilities always seem like they perform more advanced functions , like dhclient for obtaining dhcp ip addresses , or mkfs for formatting a disk .you'd have a bunch of measurement records with the same metaid ( but they'd have their own id ) and they would each match up to the meta data .what i would do is have one unique id ( that auto increments ) in the meta data table , and use that id to group together the measurements and meta data .free items would be - 1 pennies .so a cost of $ 4 . 50 gets stored as 450 .i'd present one field , and let the users type the decimal point in themselves .it also makes it easier to support countries that don't use cents if you choose to go that route .i generally store the cost as the lowest unit ( pennies ) and then convert it to whole dollars later .that way , your users don't have to tab ( or click , if they are unfamiliar with tab ) to the next field .you could store free things as 0 pennies as well , this gives you the flexibility to use 0 and - 1 to mean two slightly different things ( free vs no sale ? ) .as for presenting the data entry field , i personally don't like it when i have to keep switching fields for tiny things ( like when they break up phone numbers into 3 fields , or ip addresses into 4 ) .it's annoying as hell .i've seen a site that uses ajax for the main content .you want to do more work on your end to make it faster for the end user .i'd write the initial page server side to include that first would-be ajax call , then use actual ajax for anything after that .when the side is under load , it will display the navigation bar , then you don't see anything for another 5 seconds because it loads with an ajax call , and you've lost your place in line .floggingwhether or not you need to create a new application for mobile depends on the site you have .i would test your site on a mobile browser emulator , there are a bunch of them listed on this site .also , you might consider switching your firefox's user agent ( here ) so you can browse popular site's mobile versions , along with the source they used to lay it out .the website at my workplace could not possibly fit on a mobile phone screen ( too many frames ) , but other sites that have a more adjustment-friendly layout might just need a little tweak .togoogle searchthere are a bunch of options available .i use a jquery function that handles tooltips .you set tooltips to disappear after a set amount of time .are you looking to extend the time tooltips display on your own machine , or on a client machine ?in whatever the tooltip's end event , probably a . mouseout ( function ( ) { type of event you'd just change something that looks likeif you are changing the amount of time you want tooldips to display , then you'll create your own tooltips with javascript or some fancy css .edit :changes are on lines 4 and 20 .this is the example on the w3schools site adapted for floating text .you can also use < div style = " float : right " > text < / div > if you don't want to float every div element .to get the floating text halfway down the page , you just stick < div style = " float : right " > this is an annotation < / div > right in the middle of the < p > block .so , i need to do these things .this overrides the clipboard , unfortunately .i have to automate a program that is outside of my control .the way i'm doing this is to use sendkeys . sendwait ( " keys " ) to the other program .the problem is , there are multiple fields that might be active and no way to select a single one with confidence .ideally , it would be able to copy anything from the clipboard ( images , text , rich text ) and place it back just like nothing happened .here's what i've got so far , but it erases whatever is in the clipboard , or replaces it with something special that can't be pasted back into notepad .the fields are all different lengths , so my solution is to copy something really long , copy it to the clipboard , and look at the last character that made it though , so i know which field is selected in the other program .can i upload an unsigned apk ?edit , i downloaded the live app from the play store .so i have to find a keystore with . . . no fingerprint .after i try to upload an updated apk to the play store i get this error :i haven't updated the app in years , but i'm still using the only keystore i've ever used .i can't figure out how to get a signature fingerprint , but the keystore i'm using expires the exact same minute that the live application does ( in 2036 ) so it's definitely the key i'm trying to use .it all depends on the client base .a lot of computers at my company use win2k , so we couldn't really drop support .urlpartially from w3schools .this file will crate a single checkbox and check it depending on the <URL> ?the browsers themselves will ignore code that isn't meant for them to read .you could use conditional comments to get ie and firefox to do different thingsat what point does a mysql database start to lose performance ?i have what i believe to be a large database , with roughly 15m records which take up almost 2gb .based on these numbers , is there any incentive for me to clean the data out , or am i safe to allow it to continue scaling for a few more years ?that part was easy .i've got a menu in python .here's what i've got so far :it would be great to have something likei'm using raw_input ( ) to get the selection from the user .is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke ?the problem is that raw_input ( and input ) require the user to press enter after they make a selection .i'd say paypal or googlecheckout .if you spend a dollar on adwords , your next $ 10 on google checkout is free .google checkout is either 2 % + . 20usd or free depending on how much you spend on adwords .paypal is 1 . 9 % to 2 . 9 % + $ 0 . 30 usd ( 2 . 9 % for up to $ 30 , 000 / month , 1 . 9 % for more than $ 100 , 000 / month )without factoring in the 20 / 30 cents , paypal is just barely cheaper if you sell more than $ 100 , 000 per month , and spend nothing on adwords .i think other svn things have the same feature .if you use tortoisesvn , you can use the export feature to automatically strip out all of the . svn files .right click the root project folder , tortoisesvn > export and tell it where you want the . svn free directory .don't version that file .version a template or something .load a file on the webserver called favicon . icoat my workplace , we have two repositories .make it easy to get to a specific revision .one with public read access , and one for everything else .the revision numbers could skip prime and even numbers and still do what its supposed to do .i'd use just one for everything , but we need different access rights for public / private projects .that said , i personally don't see the problem with the revision numbers incrementing on every update .i know how to use tags in subversion .i don't care about any history except the tags .what i don't quite understand is how they work .say i dump just the head revision of a repository .i create a tag every time i get to a release milestone .is a tag just a copy , made from what ever revision i specify ?are those tags dumped along with the rest of the head revision ?finally , is all this just programming magic that i don't really want to know .or is a tag more like a reference , where internally subversion just says go to / trunk / project / revision 5 or whatever .the command to create a tag ( svn copy ) seems to imply that it's a copy , but i've seen other people write that subversion doesn't really copy anything .something like " this image belongs to . . . " .you could hide all sorts of copywrite goodies inside the image .the same method allows you include an actual file into an image .( hide a file inside of an image ) i've found that it's a bit hit-or-miss , but 7-zip files seem to work .again , it's not unbreakable by any stretch of the imagination , but it's completely invisible to the naked eye .i'm not sure how important it is to be unbreakable , but a simple solution might just be to append a text file to the end of the image .if you open the image in a viewer / browser , it looks like a normal jpeg , but if you open it in a text editor , the last line would be readable .make it easier to buy than to steal .if you put mounds of copy protection then it just makes the value of owning the real deal pretty low .you want downloading your software illegally , at the very least , to be slightly harder than buying it .use a simple activation key and assure customers that they can always get an activation key or re-download the software if they ever lose theirs .i have a pc games that i've never opened , because there is so much copy protection junk on it that it's actually easier to download the fake version .any copy protection ( aside from online-only components like multiplayer games and finance software that connects to your bank , etc . ) you can just assume will be defeated .- editchanging the name does not work .i do not have direct access to server , and adding the linescript . py . safe still give a 500 server error when you click it .either because it's not overriding something , or the line is wrong .how do i get the server to just send the file as text instead of trying to run it ?to . htaccess in the root folder does not appear to work , though i could be doing something wrong .i should also mention that the . htaccess file does work , but for some reason that one addtype line is not working .i'm trying to host a python script using an apache web server , but the server tries to run the script instead of just offering it for download .edit :this might help .are you trying to send packets in hex , or get packets in hex ?i use this function to hexify ip addresses before sending them to the hardwareand occationally i use hexsomething = hex ( val ( number ) ) . padleft ( 2 , " 0 " ) as well .at my company we have to communicate with our hardware using sort of a combination of ascii and hex .i can give you the source for the whole program too , though it's designed to talk to different hardware .something like this would be ideal :i have a wix project that installs a few exe files .the main executable is optional , and the support programs will run on their own .i would like to hide it based on if the main executable feature is installed or not .often , the end user will install a third-party program instead of my main executable .one is the ' main ' executable and the others are supporting programs to help diagnose problems .at the end of the wix installer , i want to have a ' launch program ' checkbox that will run the program as soon as the installer closes .i can hide the checkbox based on the installlevel property , but that only changes depending on if the user selected a ' typical ' or ' complete ' install .dynamically linked library .you can load a dll that generates random numbers that always start with " 5 " or something .in you program you can call crazydll . generaterandomnumberssorta ( ) and it will return the number .the same dll also has function for converting ip addresses to hexadecimal strings , and other useful code .to give you an example , if you have someone else's dll loaded into you application you can use bits of programming from it .i've created a dll with that code , and now all i have to do is drag and drop more of those ip address textbox collections without having to duplicate all that code over and over again .for a real world example , i have dll that combines 4 textboxes ( you'd use these to type ip addresses ) and it automatically only accepts numbers less than 256 , and handles pressing the backspace key to jump to a previous textbox .i like the individual pages with includes for headers and whatnot .though he also used frames , so that might be part of the problem as well .it makes it difficult to do any changes other than adding new similar pages .i have to maintain a website where the original developer used a single page with a variable in the url and it's a pain .i don't think there's any way around that .you can still place the ad near the top of the page using
